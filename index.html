  <h1>The Psychic Game</h1>
  <h2>Guess what letter I'm thinking of!</h2>
  
  
  <!-- I Need to create an array for the CPU and set my variables -->

  <!-- I need the user to choose a letter -->

  <!-- I need to make the computer select a letter -->

  <!-- I need to see if the users choice matches the computers choice -->

  <!-- If the user does not guess the letter that the computer chooses in 9 guesses then it logs a loss. The guesses will need to reset-->

  <!-- If the user guesses the computers letter then it is logged as a win . The guesses will need to reset-->

  <!-- I found a lady named "Lisa" who made a video for the bootcamp on youtube. she went over how to make a div like the one below for teh rock paper scissors game. I used her example to make my js and link it in the external file. -->
